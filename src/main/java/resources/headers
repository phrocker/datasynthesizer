Malware Examples:
Normal:
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

Malware 1:
Accept-Encoding: identity

While identity is a valid RFC compliant AE header, seeing a customer who always came in on browser X (which never uses identity by default) suddenly switch to identity was a key indicator of a malware infection. Hypothesis on why this occured: Malware writers were lazy and wanted to be able to read the page without including a gzip library.  (this forced the server to send the page uncompressed

Malware 2:
Accept-Encoding: (14 spaces before newline)

In this case, the malware writer was trying to do the same thing as identity, but didn't want to
update the request length field. instead they took  " gzip, deflate" (14 chars after the :)
and replaced with spaces, this resulted in the same request length, but the server assumes it
doesn't speak the encoding offered by the client, and produced an uncompressed page.

Malware 3:
All headers would look like this (took from the "Normal" below). Basically, the malware
writer tried to rewrite the headers as his, but didn't preserve the RFC specified case for headers.
